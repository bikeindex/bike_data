# Bike (and micromobility vehicle) data

The data here is used by [BikeIndex.org](https://bikeindex.org) to classify bikes and micromobility vehicles

- The manufacturers that Bike Index knows about: [manufacturers.csv](manufacturers.csv)
- Primary Activities: [primary_activities.csv](primary_activities.csv)
- TODO: component types

Are we missing a manufacturer? Or missing data about a manufacturer?

Are we missing a bicycle activity?

Or a component type?
